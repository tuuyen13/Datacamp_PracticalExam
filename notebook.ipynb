There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\ncategory: There were 6 category (Housing,Food, Toys, Equipment, Medicine, Accessory). There were 25 missing values. The missing values should be replaced with \"Unknown\"\n\nanimal: There were four values that matches the four given in the data dictionary. There were no missing values so no changes were made to this column.\n\nsize: The values of this column actually only have 3 value but turn 9 because it have different writing styles lowercase, uppercase. The values should be in consisent format by converting to proper case to represent 3 size (Large, Medium, Small). There are no missing values. \n\nprice: The values of this column ranged from 12.85 to 54.16, which is consistent with the description given. 150 values were missing. The missing values were replaced with the median value of the remaining data, which was 28.06\n\nsales: The values of this column ranged from 999.75 to 1004.82, which is consistent with the description given.There were no missing values and no changes were made to this column.\n\nrating: The values of this column ranged from 1 to 9, don't have value 10.

Since PetMind is particularly interested in increasing sales by offering more recurring products of everyday use (i.e. Food), we should also look into repeat and one-time items in the category, to evaluate how much room there is to increase the number of repeat products.\n\nAs you can see, customer tends to repeatedly by the product when the number of repeat products is at least 300 more than the number of one-time products. Customers who buy products repeattedly have the most observations(around 906). Then we have customers who repeat purchases(about 594 observations) so observations are not really balanced across categories of the variable repeat purchases. This would suggest that the team should focus on customers who repeat purchases to increase sales as they are more common.\n\nIn addtion, the second chart is spilitted by seven category included in this data to see the difference between them for more insights. Equiqment is the variable repeat purchases has the most observations with 211 observations, while Unknow category has the least observations (only 14). On the other hand, four categories (Medicine, Housing, Food, Toys) are realtively balanced with observations do not seem different, ranged from 145 to 153. Finally, Accessory has roughly half the amount of recurring products when compared to the four categories previously described.

In order to observe how products are performing, we can distribute the sales in intervals of 100 sales in a histogram\n\nLooking at the chart, we can see that most sales value ranged from more than 250 and less than 1500. The value reach its peak at 1000. The distribution of all of the sales can be described as a normal distribution. \n\nIn order to observe how products are performing, we can distribute the sales and see that most products have around 1100 sales or less, with a few of them getting up to around 1500 sales. A small portion of products, considered outliers, have higher sales than that, going up to around 2250 sales. When looking for products that have high sales the team should aim for the value is over 1750 and investigate why this they were sold more than others.\n\nThis graph alone won't tell us whether selling a product recurrently is connected with a higher number of sales, so let's compare these variables on Task 4.","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![image-4](image-4.png)\n\nLet's now compare the variables and see how the repeat purchase impacts sales with a boxplot. PetMind wants to increase its number of sales by turning more everyday products into repeat products, so we should check whether repeat products sell more than one-time products.\n\n\nThe boxplot show the distribution between sales and repeat purchase. It can be seen that the median sale value of both repeat products and one-time products is close at 1000. Besides that, the IQR value is also similar so that it can be concluded that the repeat purchase doesn't affect too much on sale of products.\n\nIn both groups, there are some outliers on the right, representing products with a high volume of sales. Having products with a high volume of sales is positive, and there are more outliers in the repeat products group. However, we must be careful when taking those outliers into account, since the group of repeat products contains more products - 906 products are repeat, whereas 594 are one-time - therefore while this could be an indication that recurring products sell more, it may also be natural to have more outliers in this group due to its size.\n\nIf we disregard the outliers, the spread is slightly smaller among repeat products, indicating their sales are more predictable.\n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![image-5](image-5.png)\n\nWe have seven category, so I break boxplot into seven to describe the relationship between repeat purchases and sales of each category to get more insights. Based on the chart, the company can choose which category should sell more everyday products repeatedly to increase sales.\n\nSpilitting the boxplot by category, it can be seen that there is different between seven category. More than a half having the median value is more than 1000 - the overall median sale value of repeat products and one-time products. Toys is the category having the highest median value while the IQR value of accessory is more than other remain categories. \n\nOn the other hand, it does not seem big different in distribution of sales in seven category between repeat products compared to non-repreat products,except for accessory having the difference in median value.
